# Password Manager
___
I created this project to both test and improve my python skills in developing both developing a cipher and creating an
interactive GUI with tkinter. This project allow the user to save passwords and as well as create randomly generated 
passwords that are then encrypted into a cipher then translated to hexadecimal then into binary to make the txt file
harder to read. The cipher is unique for each txt file that save passwords but my program is able to decrypt ciphers it
generated and display to the user when they provide the correct password to open the file.
